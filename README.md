Flash Chat App is a group messaging application inspired by the idea of having a personal group without compromising privacy. It provides users with an exceptional group chatting experience and offers a range of upcoming features, including private mode chat (where names are not visible except to the admin in urgent or emergency cases), polls, bill splitting, UPI money transfers, creating new groups, multiple groups with different participants and purposes, and much more.
